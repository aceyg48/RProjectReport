# RProjectReport
Just a report for DSC-140S
The csv file contains the file used in the report, Academic User.
The Academic Business is not used.
The R file shows implementation of the file in different scatter plots
and numerous correlation scores. My main goal was to try and find the 
best way to get popular and be impactful on as a yelp reviewer.
